		<h3 style="padding:2px 6px 4px 6px; color: rgb(255, 255, 240); background-color: rgba(0, 157, 0, 0.5)">Steve was offered to Kathleen as a gift by one of her younger family members, and has been a part of this idiosyncratic family ever since. Offering a great deal of wisdom, and a shoulder to cry on when life gets tough. Steve, despite being a sloth, is quick on his feet in terms of his wittiness.</h3>
