		<h3 style="padding:2px 6px 4px 6px; color: rgb(255, 255, 240); background-color: rgba(0, 157, 0, 0.5)">Amber is a Lemar by origin, who grew up in the Amazon. One day she was Lemar-ing around, when she was about to be shot by Jeff Bezo's, but he took pity on Amber instead of shooting her, and instead took her captive and shipped her back to America (in an impressive two days btw). It was in America though where she overcame the odds and fell in love with Drew despite their species-differences.</h3>
